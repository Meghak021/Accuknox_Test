Task: Implementing a Rectangle Class
The Rectangle class should allow instances to be initialized with length and width, and should support iteration to yield length and width in a specific format.

Code Snippet:
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length: int, width: int):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def __iter__(self):
        yield {"length": self.length}
        yield {"width": self.width}

# Testing the Rectangle class
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 10)
for dimension in rectangle:
    print(dimension)

Output:
{'length': 5}
{'width': 10}

This class meets the requirements:

1.Initializes with length and width.
2.Supports iteration over instances.
3.Produces the required output format when iterated.
